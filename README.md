# bp7

## Overview

bp7 is a basic machine learning library for Golang. This library implements the backpropagation learning algorithm and its network is structured with only one hidden layer (and obviously one output layer). At least with the normalized breast cancer set from the Wisconsin University, it has a 96.04% accuracy in prediction.

Feel free to extend it and modify it according to your needs.
